base image with Steam
=====================

Please remember that
you don't need to provide your personal credentials to download a dedicated server
if "login anonymous" works!

You most probably want to use it like this on the console:

```bash
/opt/steam/steamcmd.sh +login anonymous +force_install_dir /var/lib/steam/ark-dedicated +app_update 376030 validate +quit

# then run the game
cd /var/lib/steam/ark-dedicated/ShooterGame/Binaries/Linux/
./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen?SessionName=<SERVERNAME>?ServerAdminPassword=<ADMINPASSWORT> -server -log
```

It is a good idea to store folder ```/var/lib/steam``` outside the Docker container.
